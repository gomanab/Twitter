Small Twitter like application

I made a small change for how the user follows another user. Instead of having to type the ID of a user to follow, the user can simply click on a user in the main application tree list and click follow. This will automatically follow the selected user without having to type in the ID of that user. A user cannot follow themselves, and a warning message will appear if they try to do so.
